# Brain Tumor Detection using KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM

## Project Overview

This project explores the detection of brain tumors through the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. It utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. This README offers a concise comparison of these methods, emphasizing their effectiveness and suitability for medical image analysis tasks. For a more detailed project background and methodology, refer to the attached PDF document, 'Vadana_Ioan_Grigore_334AA_KNN&NB'.

# Source Code
knn_nb_stack.py: Implements a stacking ensemble model that combines KNN and NB, using Logistic Regression as the meta-learner. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both classifiers to improve prediction accuracy.
svm_model.py: Contains the implementation of the SVM model, which is configured with a linear kernel to classify the processed MRI images.

# Training and Evaluation Process
# Both models were trained on a dataset of preprocessed and labeled MRI images. The following metrics were used to evaluate the models:

## Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
## Precision: Indicates the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
## Recall: Measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
## F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to assess model performance.

## Usage

Place your dataset in two separate folders, one for tumor and another for no_tumor images.
Update the folder paths in the script:

tumor_images, tumor_labels = load_images_from_folder('path_to_tumor_images', 1)
no_tumor_images, no_tumor_labels = load_images_from_folder('path_to_no_tumor_images', 0)

Run the script to train and test the SVM model on your data.

# Results and Comparison

# KNN/NB Results
## Accuracy: Detailed accuracy figures are provided in the results section.
## Precision and Recall: Specific values for each class (tumor, no tumor) help understand the model's ability to distinguish and correctly classify images.
## F1 Score: Summarizes the balance between precision and recall.

# SVM Results
## Accuracy: Direct comparison with the KNN/NB model shows how SVM performs with a different algorithmic approach.
## Precision and Recall: Evaluated for the same classes, allowing for direct metric comparison.
## F1 Score: Provides insight into the SVM's overall efficiency in balancing recall and precision.

# Comparison
Performance: The SVM model typically offers strong performance on image classification tasks, especially with a well-tuned kernel. The stacking model (KNN/NB) attempts to improve prediction robustness by combining classifier predictions.
Complexity and Speed: SVMs can be computationally intensive, especially with large datasets and complex kernels, whereas KNN/NB, though simpler, might require substantial memory.
Suitability: Depending on the dataset characteristics (size, imbalance), one model may outperform the other. The detailed analysis explores these aspects, providing a guide on when to use each model effectively.
Visual Results: The provided graphs and performance charts (confusion matrices, ROC curves) visually underline the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, assisting in a clearer understanding of practical implications.

## Disclaimer
The performance of the model depends on the quality and size of the dataset. This script is intended for educational purposes and may require adjustments for production use.
